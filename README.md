# Paper Mario: TSS by Paper Crafters
A new Paper Mario 64 experience with a hint of Super Mario Galaxy!

Paper Mario: TSS (previously named Beyond the Dream) is a WIP hack of Paper Mario that aims to create an original story with references to Super Mario Galaxy. At this time, there is no set release date, due to how new the hack is. You can join [this server](https://discord.gg/bN4hrXNgRW) for help that is needed, or to just keep up with the mod. 

This repository will have the public releases on it, so you can watch here for when a potential demo comes out. This will also be the place for when the finished project comes around. With that being said, that won't be for a while still. But check back when we get closer to a demo


If you have any questions about the project, or how you can help, just join the [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/bN4hrXNgRW)

# The General Story
It had been a few months since Mario defeated Bowser, and returned the Star Rod to Star Haven. The Bros were sitting at home when they Parakarry delivers to them a letter from the Princess. She invites Mario and Luigi to join her and Toadsworth in the faraway Starfield Islands where a festival will ensue for the seven Grand Stars, a festival that only happens once every 50 years. With this, Mario and Luigi sail out to the Island and meet the Princess and Toadsworth there. While at the festival, everything is alright until Bowser comes in with his army and steals the seven Grand Stars. A quick fight with Bowser sends him Mario falling into a forest, where he meets a star called Luna, who's apparently the one who was supposed to watch over the Grand Stars. Enlisting his help, Mario and Luna set out to retrieve the Grand Stars from Bowser's grasp.

# Playing on console (N64)
This mod will be compatiable with Everdrive support, so you may wish to play on console. If that's the case, all you need is an Everdrive flashcart, and an SD card to put your patched rom on. Simply put the SD card into the flashcart, put it in the N64, and open the rom from there, and the game will run
