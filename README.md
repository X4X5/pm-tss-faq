A new Paper Mario 64 experience with a hint of Super Mario Galaxy!

Paper Mario: Beyond the Dream is a WIP hack of Paper Mario that aims to create an original story with references to Super Mario Galaxy. At this time, there is no set release date, due to how new the hack is, and I've only started work on it. You can join [this server](https://discord.gg/bN4hrXNgRW) for help that is needed. 

What will be saved on this repository is maps, strings, ect. The official builds of the patch file will be in releases. They will be released as .zip files, and will have a changelog. Please read the changelog before playing. Maybe you'll find something useful!

If you have any questions about the project, or how you can help, just join the [Discord server!](https://discord.gg/bN4hrXNgRW) 

Have a nice day!
