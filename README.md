# Paper Mario: Beyond the Dream by Paper Crafters
A new Paper Mario 64 experience with a hint of Super Mario Galaxy!

Paper Mario: Beyond the Dream is a WIP hack of Paper Mario that aims to create an original story with references to Super Mario Galaxy. At this time, there is no set release date, due to how new the hack is. You can join [this server](https://discord.gg/bN4hrXNgRW) for help that is needed, or to just keep up with the mod. 

This repository will have the public releases on it, so you can watch here for when a potential demo comes out. This will also be the place for when the finished project comes around. With that being said, that won't be for a while still. But check back when we get closer to a demo

# Playing on console (N64)
This mod will be compatiable with Everdrive support, so you may wish to play on console. If that's the case, all you need is an Everdrive flashcart, and an SD card to put your patched rom on. Simply put the SD card into the flashcart, put it in the N64, and open the rom from there, and the game will run
